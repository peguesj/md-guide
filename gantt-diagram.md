## Gantt Chart

A [Gantt Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart), is a powerful tool used for **project management**. It visually represents a **project schedule**, allowing managers and team members to see the start and end dates of the entire project at a glance. The diagram displays tasks or activities along a horizontal time axis, showing the **duration** of each task, their **sequence**, and how they overlap or run concurrently.

In a Gantt Chart, each task is represented by a bar, the length and position of which reflects the **start date**, **duration**, and **end date** of the task. This format makes it easy to understand **dependencies** between tasks, where one task must be completed before another can start. Additionally, Gantt Diagrams can include **milestones**, which are significant events or goals in the project timeline, marked as a distinct symbol.

In the context of creating Gantt Charts, **PlantUML** offers several advantages. It provides a **text-based approach** to diagram creation, making it easy to track changes using **version control systems**. This approach is particularly beneficial for teams who are already accustomed to text-based coding environments. PlantUML's syntax for Gantt Charts is **straightforward**, enabling quick modifications and updates to the project timeline. Additionally, the **integration of PlantUML with other tools** and its ability to generate diagrams dynamically from text makes it a versatile choice for teams looking to automate and streamline their project management documentation. The use of PlantUML for Gantt Charts thus combines the **clarity and efficiency** of visual project planning with the **flexibility and control** of a text-based system.


## Declaring tasks

The Gantt is described in *natural* language, using very simple sentences (subject-verb-complement).

Tasks defined using square bracket. 

### Workload 

The workload for each task is specified using the ``requires`` verb, indicating the amount of work needed in terms of days.


```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days
-- All example --
[Task 1 (1 day)] requires 1 day
[T2 (5 days)] requires 5 days
[T3 (1 week)] requires 1 week
[T4 (1 week and 4 days)] requires 1 week and 4 days
[T5 (2 weeks)] requires 2 weeks
@endgantt
```

A week is typically understood as a span of seven days. However, in contexts where certain days are designated as 'closed' (like weekends), a week can be redefined in terms of 'non-closed' days. For example, if Saturday and Sunday are marked as closed, then a week in this context will equate to a five-day workload, corresponding to the remaining weekdays.

### Start

Their beginning are defined using the ``start`` verb:

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days

Project starts 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] starts 2020-07-01
[Test prototype] starts 2020-07-16
@endgantt
```
```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires  10 days

[Prototype design] starts D+0
[Test prototype] starts D+15
@endgantt
```

*[Ref. for ``D+nn`` form: [QA-14494](https://forum.plantuml.net/14494/is-it-possible-to-color-the-days-in-the-default-gantt-diagram?show=14550#c14550)]*

### End

Their ending are defined using the ``end`` verb:

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days

Project starts 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] ends 2020-07-15
[Test prototype] ends 2020-07-25
@endgantt
```
```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days

[Prototype design] ends D+14
[Test prototype] ends D+24
@endgantt
```
### Start/End

It is possible to define both absolutely, by specifying dates:
```plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] starts 2020-07-01
[Test prototype] starts 2020-07-16
[Prototype design] ends 2020-07-15
[Test prototype] ends 2020-07-25

@endgantt
```
```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] starts D+0
[Test prototype] starts D+15
[Prototype design] ends D+14
[Test prototype] ends D+24
@endgantt
```


## One-line declaration (with the and conjunction)

It is possible to combine declaration on one line with the ``and`` conjunction.

```plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] starts 2020-07-01 and ends 2020-07-15
[Test prototype] starts 2020-07-16 and requires 10 days
@endgantt
```


## Adding constraints
It is possible to add constraints between tasks.

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
@endgantt
```

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 10 days
[Code prototype] requires 10 days
[Write tests] requires 5 days
[Code prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Write tests] starts at [Code prototype]'s start
@endgantt
```


## Short names or alias
It is possible to define short name for tasks with the ``as`` keyword.

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] as [D] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] as [T] requires 10 days
[T] starts at [D]'s end
@endgantt
```


## Tasks with same name

_[Starting with V1.2024.6,]_ it is possible to have multiple tasks with same name.

```plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts 2020-11-08
[Task 7 days] as [T7] starts at 2020-11-09
[T7] ends at 2020-11-15
[Task 7 days] as [T7bis] starts at 2020-11-09
[T7bis] ends at 2020-11-15
@endgantt
```

```plantuml
@startgantt
[SameTaskName] as [T1] lasts 7 days and is colored in pink
[SameTaskName] as [T2] lasts 3 days and is colored in orange
[T1] -> [T2]
@endgantt
```

*[Ref. [QA-12176](https://forum.plantuml.net/12176) and [GH-1809](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/issues/1809)]*


## Customize colors
It is also possible to customize [colors](color) with ``is colored in``.

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 13 days
[Test prototype] requires 4 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Prototype design] is colored in Fuchsia/FireBrick
[Test prototype] is colored in GreenYellow/Green
@endgantt
```


## Completion status
### Adding completion depending percentage
You can set the completion status of a task, by the command:
* ``is xx% completed``
* ``is xx% complete`` 

```plantuml
@startgantt
[foo] requires 21 days
[foo] is 40% completed
[bar] requires 30 days and is 10% complete
@endgantt
```

### Change colour of completion (by style)

```plantuml
@startgantt

<style>
ganttDiagram {
  task {
    BackGroundColor GreenYellow
    LineColor Green 
    unstarted {
      BackGroundColor Fuchsia 
      LineColor FireBrick
    }
  }
}
</style>

[Prototype design] requires 7 days
[Test prototype 0] requires 4 days
[Test prototype 10] requires 4 days
[Test prototype 20] requires 4 days
[Test prototype 30] requires 4 days
[Test prototype 40] requires 4 days
[Test prototype 50] requires 4 days
[Test prototype 60] requires 4 days
[Test prototype 70] requires 4 days
[Test prototype 80] requires 4 days
[Test prototype 90] requires 4 days
[Test prototype 100] requires 4 days

[Test prototype 0] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 10] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 20] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 30] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 40] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 50] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 60] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 70] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 80] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 90] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype 100] starts at [Prototype design]'s end

[Test prototype 0] is 0% complete
[Test prototype 10] is 10% complete
[Test prototype 20] is 20% complete
[Test prototype 30] is 30% complete
[Test prototype 40] is 40% complete
[Test prototype 50] is 50% complete
[Test prototype 60] is 60% complete
[Test prototype 70] is 70% complete
[Test prototype 80] is 80% complete
[Test prototype 90] is 90% complete
[Test prototype 100] is 100% complete

@endgantt
```

### Change colour of undone part of Task (by style)

```plantuml
@startgantt
<style>
ganttDiagram {
  task {
    BackGroundColor GreenYellow
    LineColor Green 
  }
  undone {
    BackGroundColor red
  }
}
</style>

[foo] lasts 21 days
[foo] is 40% completed
[bar] lasts 30 days and is 10% complete
@endgantt
```

*[Ref. [QA-15299](https://forum.plantuml.net/15299/how-to-set-color-of-the-gantt-unstarted-task)]*


## Milestone
You can define Milestones using the ``happen`` verb.

### Relative milestone (use of constraints)
```plantuml
@startgantt
[Test prototype] requires 10 days
[Prototype completed] happens at [Test prototype]'s end
[Setup assembly line] requires 12 days
[Setup assembly line] starts at [Test prototype]'s end
@endgantt
```

### Absolute milestone (use of fixed date)
```plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts 2020-07-01
[Test prototype] requires 10 days
[Prototype completed] happens 2020-07-10
[Setup assembly line] requires 12 days
[Setup assembly line] starts at [Test prototype]'s end
@endgantt
```


### Milestone of maximum end of tasks
```plantuml
@startgantt
[Task1] requires 4 days
then [Task1.1] requires 4 days
[Task1.2] starts at [Task1]'s end and requires 7 days

[Task2] requires 5 days
then [Task2.1] requires 4 days

[MaxTaskEnd] happens at [Task1.1]'s end
[MaxTaskEnd] happens at [Task1.2]'s end
[MaxTaskEnd] happens at [Task2.1]'s end

@endgantt
```
*[Ref. [QA-10764](https://forum.plantuml.net/10764/gantt-multiple-tasks-as-prerequisite-for-a-milestone)]*


## Hyperlinks
You can add hyperlinks to tasks.

```plantuml
@startgantt
[task1] requires 10 days
[task1] links to [[http://plantuml.com]]
@endgantt
```


## Calendar
You can specify a starting date for the whole project. By default, the first task starts at this date.

```plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts the 20th of september 2017
[Prototype design] as [TASK1] requires 13 days
[TASK1] is colored in Lavender/LightBlue
@endgantt
```


## Coloring days

It is possible to add [colors](color) to some days.

```plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts the 2020/09/01 

2020/09/07 is colored in salmon
2020/09/13 to 2020/09/16 are colored in lightblue

[Prototype design] as [TASK1] requires 22 days
[TASK1] is colored in Lavender/LightBlue
[Prototype completed] happens at [TASK1]'s end
@endgantt
```


## Changing scale

## Weekscale with Weeknumbers or Calendar Date

### With Weeknumbers *(by default)*
```plantuml

[Task1] on {Alice} requires 2 weeks
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} requires 2 weeks
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} requires 3 days

```

### With Weeknumbers *(starting from 1)*
```plantuml

Project starts the 6th of July 2020
[Task1] on {Alice} requires 2 weeks
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} requires 2 weeks

```
*[Ref. [GH-525](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/issues/525)]*

###  With Calendar Date
```plantuml

Project starts the 6th of July 2020
[Task1] on {Alice} requires 2 weeks
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} requires 2 weeks

@endgantt
```

## Close day
It is possible to close some day.

```plantuml
@startgantt
project starts the 2018/04/09
saturday are closed
sunday are closed
2018/05/01 is closed
2018/04/17 to 2018/04/19 is closed
[Prototype design] requires 14 days
[Test prototype] requires 4 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Prototype design] is colored in Fuchsia/FireBrick
[Test prototype] is colored in GreenYellow/Green
@endgantt
```


Then it is possible to open some closed day.

```plantuml
@startgantt
2020-07-07 to 2020-07-17 is closed
2020-07-13 is open

Project starts the 2020-07-01
[Prototype design] requires 10 days
Then [Test prototype] requires 10 days
@endgantt
```


## Definition of a week depending of closed days

A **week** is a synonym for how many non-closed days are in a week, as:
```plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts 2021-03-29
[Review 01] happens at 2021-03-29
[Review 02 - 3 weeks] happens on 3 weeks after [Review 01]'s end
[Review 02 - 21 days] happens on 21 days after [Review 01]'s end
@endgantt
```

So if you specify *Saturday* and *Sunday* as closed, a **week** will be equivalent to 5 days, as:
```plantuml
@startgantt
Project starts 2021-03-29
saturday are closed
sunday are closed
[Review 01] happens at 2021-03-29
[Review 02 - 3 weeks] happens on 3 weeks after [Review 01]'s end
[Review 02 - 21 days] happens on 21 days after [Review 01]'s end
@endgantt
```

*[Ref. [QA-13434](https://forum.plantuml.net/13434/gantt-milestone-bug?show=13449#c13449)]*


## Working days

It is possible to manage working days.

```plantuml
@startgantt

saturday are closed
sunday are closed
2022-07-04 to 2022-07-15 is closed

Project starts 2022-06-27
[task1] starts at 2022-06-27 and requires 1 week
[task2] starts 2 working days after [task1]'s end and requires 3 days

@endgantt

## Simplified task succession
It's possible to use the ``then`` keyword to denote consecutive tasks.

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 14 days
then [Test prototype] requires 4 days
then [Deploy prototype] requires 6 days
@endgantt
```

You can also use arrow ``->``


```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 14 days
[Build prototype] requires 4 days
[Prepare test] requires 6 days
[Prototype design] -> [Build prototype]
[Prototype design] -> [Prepare test]
@endgantt
```


## Working with resources
You can affect tasks on resources using the ``on`` keyword and brackets for resource name.


```plantuml
@startgantt
[Task1] on {Alice} requires 10 days
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} requires 2 days
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} requires 1 days
@endgantt
```

Multiple resources can be assigned to a task:


```plantuml
@startgantt
[Task1] on {Alice} {Bob} requires 20 days
@endgantt
```

Resources can be marked as off on specific days:

```plantuml
@startgantt
project starts on 2020-06-19
[Task1] on {Alice} requires 10 days
{Alice} is off on 2020-06-24 to 2020-06-26
@endgantt
```


## Hide resources

### Without any hiding (by default)

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Task1] on {Alice} requires 10 days
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} requires 2 days
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} requires 1 days
then [Task4] on {Alice:25%} {Bob} requires 1 days
@endgantt
```


### Hide resources names

You can hide resources names and percentage, on tasks, using the ``hide resources names`` keywords.

```plantuml
@startgantt
hide resources names
[Task1] on {Alice} requires 10 days
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} requires 2 days
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} requires 1 days
then [Task4] on {Alice:25%} {Bob} requires 1 days
@endgantt
```

### Hide resources footbox

You can also hide resources names on bottom of the diagram using the `` hide resources footbox`` keywords.

```plantuml
@startgantt
hide resources footbox
[Task1] on {Alice} requires 10 days
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} requires 2 days
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} requires 1 days
then [Task4] on {Alice:25%} {Bob} requires 1 days
@endgantt
```

### Hide the both (resources names and resources footbox)

You can also hide the both.

```plantuml
@startgantt
hide resources names
hide resources footbox
[Task1] on {Alice} requires  10 days
[Task2] on {Bob:50%} requires 2 days
then [Task3] on {Alice:25%} requires 1 days
then [Task4] on {Alice:25%} {Bob} requires 1 days
@endgantt
```


## Horizontal Separator

You can use ``--`` to separate sets of tasks.

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Task1] requires 10 days
then [Task2] requires 4 days
-- Phase Two --
then [Task3] requires 5 days
then [Task4] requires 6 days
@endgantt
```


## Vertical Separator

You can add Vertical Separators with the syntax: ``Separator just [at]``.

```plantuml
@startgantt
[task1] requires 1 week
[task2] starts 20 days after [task1]'s end and requires 3 days

Separator just at [task1]'s end
Separator just 2 days after [task1]'s end

Separator just at [task2]'s start
Separator just 2 days before [task2]'s start
@endgantt
```

*[Ref. [QA-16247](https://forum.plantuml.net/16247/gantt-chart-vertical-separators)]*


## Complex example
It also possible to use the ``and`` conjunction.

You can also add delays in constraints.


```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 13 days and is colored in Lavender/LightBlue
[Test prototype] requires 9 days and is colored in Coral/Green and starts 3 days after [Prototype design]'s end
[Write tests] requires 5 days and ends at [Prototype design]'s end
[Hire tests writers] requires 6 days and ends at [Write tests]'s start
[Init and write tests report] is colored in Coral/Green
[Init and write tests report] starts 1 day before [Test prototype]'s start and ends at [Test prototype]'s end
@endgantt
```


## Comments

As is mentioned on [Common Commands page](commons#560kta2oz3a2k362kjbm):
> Everything that starts with ``simple quote '`` is a comment.
>
> You can also put comments on several lines using ``/'`` to start and ``'/`` to end.
*(i.e.: the first character (except space character) of a comment line must be a ``simple quote '``)*


```plantuml
@startgantt
' This is a comment

[T1] requires 3 days

/' this comment
is on several lines '/

[T2] starts at [T1]'s end and requires 1 day
@endgantt
```


## Using style

### Without style (by default)
```plantuml
@startgantt
[Task1] requires 20 days
note bottom
  memo1 ...
  memo2 ...
  explanations1 ...
  explanations2 ...
end note
[Task2] requires 4 days
[Task1] -> [Task2]
-- Separator title --
[M1] happens on 5 days after [Task1]'s end
-- end --
@endgantt
```


### With style

You can use [style](style-evolution) to change rendering of elements.

```plantuml
@startgantt
<style>
ganttDiagram {
	task {
		FontName Helvetica
		FontColor red
		FontSize 18
		FontStyle bold
		BackGroundColor GreenYellow
		LineColor blue
	}
	milestone {

		FontSize 25
		FontStyle italic
		BackGroundColor yellow
		LineColor red
	}
	note {
		FontColor DarkGreen
		FontSize 10
		LineColor OrangeRed
	}
	arrow {
		FontName Helvetica
		FontColor red
		FontSize 18
		FontStyle bold
		BackGroundColor GreenYellow
		LineColor blue
	}
	separator {
		LineColor red
		BackGroundColor green
		FontSize 16
		FontStyle bold
		FontColor purple
	}
}
</style>
[Task1] requires 20 days
note bottom
  memo1 ...
  memo2 ...
  explanations1 ...
  explanations2 ...
end note
[Task2] requires 4 days
[Task1] -> [Task2]
-- Separator title --
[M1] happens on 5 days after [Task1]'s end
-- end --
@endgantt
```

*Thanks for style for Separator and all style for Arrow (thickness...)*

### Clean style

With style, you can also clean a Gantt diagram *(showing tasks, dependencies and relative durations only - but no actual start date and no actual scale)*: 
```plantuml
@startgantt
<style>
ganttDiagram {
  timeline {
    LineColor transparent
    FontColor transparent
 }
}
</style>

hide footbox
[Test prototype] requires 7 days
[Prototype completed] happens at [Test prototype]'s end
[Setup assembly line] requires 9 days
[Setup assembly line] starts at [Test prototype]'s end
then [Setup] requires 5 days
[T2] requires 2 days and starts at [Test prototype]'s end
then [T3] requires 3 days
-- end task --
then [T4] requires 2 days
@endgantt
```

[Prototype design] pauses on 2018/12/14
[Prototype design] pauses on monday
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end and requires 2 weeks
@endgantt
```


## Change link colors

You can change link colors:
* with this syntax: ``with <color> <style> link``
```plantuml
@startgantt
[T1] requires 4 days
[T2] requires 4 days and starts 3 days after [T1]'s end with blue dotted link
[T3] requires 4 days and starts 3 days after [T2]'s end with green bold link
[T4] requires 4 days and starts 3 days after [T3]'s end with green dashed link
@endgantt
```


* or directly by using arrow style

```plantuml
@startgantt
<style>
ganttDiagram {
	arrow {
		LineColor blue
	}
}
</style>
[Prototype design] requires 7 days
[Build prototype] requires 4 days
[Prepare test] requires 6 days
[Prototype design] -[#FF00FF]-> [Build prototype]
[Prototype design] -[dotted]-> [Prepare test]
Then [Run test]  requires 4 days
@endgantt
```

*[Ref. [QA-13693](https://forum.plantuml.net/13693)]*


## Tasks or Milestones on the same line

You can put Tasks or Milestones on the same line, with this syntax: 
* `[T|M] displays on same row as [T|M]`

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 13 days
[Test prototype] requires 4 days and 1 week
[Test prototype] starts 1 week and 2 days after [Prototype design]'s end
[Test prototype] displays on same row as [Prototype design]
[r1] happens on 5 days after [Prototype design]'s end
[r2] happens on 5 days after [r1]'s end
[r3] happens on 5 days after [r2]'s end
[r2] displays on same row as [r1]
[r3] displays on same row as [r1]

## Removing Foot Boxes (example for all scale)

You can use the ``hide footbox`` keywords to remove the foot boxes
of the gantt diagram *(as for [sequence diagram](sequence-diagram))*.

Examples on:

* daily scale *(without project start)*
```plantuml
@startgantt

hide footbox
title Foot Box removed

[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days
@endgantt
```

* daily scale
```plantuml
@startgantt

Project starts the 20th of september 2017
[Prototype design] as [TASK1] requires 13 days
[TASK1] is colored in Lavender/LightBlue

hide footbox
@endgantt
```

* weekly scale
```plantuml
@startgantt
hide footbox

printscale weekly

2021-01-18 to 2021-01-22 are named [End's committee]
2021-01-18 to 2021-01-22 are colored in salmon 
@endgantt
```


* monthly scale
```plantuml
@startgantt

@endgantt
```

* quarterly scale
```plantuml
@startgantt

## Language of the calendar

You can choose the language of the Gantt calendar, with the ``language <xx>`` command where ``<xx>`` is the [ISO 639 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) of the language.

## Delete Tasks or Milestones

You can mark some Tasks or Milestones as `deleted` instead of normally completed to distinguish tasks that may possibly have been discarded, postponed or whatever.

```plantuml
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 1 weeks
then [Prototype completed] requires 4 days
[End Prototype completed] happens at [Prototype completed]'s end
then [Test prototype] requires 5 days
[End Test prototype] happens at [Test prototype]'s end

[Prototype completed] is deleted
[End Prototype completed] is deleted
@endgantt
```

*[Ref. [QA-9129](https://forum.plantuml.net/9129)]*


## Start a project, a task or a milestone  a number of days before or after today

You can start a project, a task or a milestone a number of days before or after today, using the builtin functions ``%now`` and ``%date``:

```plantuml
@startgantt
title Today is %date("YYYY-MM-dd")
!$now = %now()
!$past = %date("YYYY-MM-dd", $now - 14*24*3600)
Project starts $past
today is colored in pink
[foo] requires 10 days
[bar] requires 5 days and starts %date("YYYY-MM-dd", $now + 4*24*3600)
[Tomorrow] happens %date("YYYY-MM-dd", $now + 1*24*3600)
@endgantt
```

*[Ref. [QA-16285](https://forum.plantuml.net/16285)]*


## Change Label position

### The labels are near elements *(by default)*
```plantuml
@startgantt
[Task1] requires 1 days
then [Task2_long_long_long] as [T2] requires 2 days
-- Phase Two --
then [Task3] as [T3] requires 2 days
[Task4] as [T4] requires 1 day
[Task5] as [T5] requires 2 days
[T2] -> [T4]
[T2] -> [T5]
[Task6_long_long_long] as [T6] requires 4 days
[T3] -> [T6]
[T5] -> [T6]
[End] happens 1 day after [T6]'s end
@endgantt
```

To change the label position, you can use the command ``label``:

```plantuml
@startebnf
label = "Label on", ('first'|'last'), " column" , ['and', ('left'|'right'), ' aligned'];
@endebnf
```

### Label on first column

* Left aligned
```plantuml
@startgantt
Label on first column and left aligned
[Task1] requires 1 days
then [Task2_long_long_long] as [T2] requires 2 days
-- Phase Two --
then [Task3] as [T3] requires 2 days
[Task4] as [T4] requires 1 day
[Task5] as [T5] requires 2 days
[T2] -> [T4]
[T2] -> [T5]
[Task6_long_long_long] as [T6] requires 4 days
[T3] -> [T6]
[T5] -> [T6]
[End] happens 1 day after [T6]'s end
@endgantt
```

* Right aligned
```plantuml
@startgantt
Label on first column and right aligned
[Task1] requires 1 days
then [Task2_long_long_long] as [T2] requires 2 days
-- Phase Two --
then [Task3] as [T3] requires 2 days
[Task4] as [T4] requires 1 day
[Task5] as [T5] requires 2 days
[T2] -> [T4]
[T2] -> [T5]
[Task6_long_long_long] as [T6] requires 4 days
[T3] -> [T6]
[T5] -> [T6]
[End] happens 1 day after [T6]'s end
@endgantt
```

### Label on last column
* Left aligned
```plantuml
@startgantt
Label on last column and left aligned
[Task1] requires 1 days
then [Task2_long_long_long] as [T2] requires 2 days
-- Phase Two --
then [Task3] as [T3] requires 2 days
[Task4] as [T4] requires 1 day
[Task5] as [T5] requires 2 days
[T2] -> [T4]
[T2] -> [T5]
[Task6_long_long_long] as [T6] requires 4 days
[T3] -> [T6]
[T5] -> [T6]
[End] happens 1 day after [T6]'s end
@endgantt
```

* Right aligned
```plantuml
@startgantt
