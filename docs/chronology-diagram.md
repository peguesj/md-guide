## Chronology Diagram

The Chronology Diagram, adapted from [Gantt Chart](gantt-diagram), is described in *natural* language, using very simple sentences (subject-verb-complement).

To activate this feature, the diagram must:
* begin with ``@startchronology`` keyword
* end with ``@endchronology`` keyword. 


## Declaring tasks or milestone 

Tasks defined using square bracket.
