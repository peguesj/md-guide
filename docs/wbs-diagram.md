## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

A [Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure) is a key **project management tool** that breaks down a project into smaller, more **manageable components** or tasks. It's essentially a **hierarchical decomposition** of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.

**PlantUML** can be particularly useful for creating **WBS diagrams**. Its **text-based diagramming** means that creating and updating a WBS is as straightforward as editing a text document, which is especially beneficial for managing changes over the project's lifecycle. This approach allows for easy integration with **version control systems**, ensuring that all changes are tracked and the history of the WBS evolution is maintained.

Moreover, PlantUML's compatibility with various other tools enhances its utility in **collaborative environments**. Teams can easily integrate their WBS diagrams into broader project documentation and management systems. The simplicity of PlantUML's syntax allows for quick adjustments, which is crucial in **dynamic project environments** where the scope and tasks may frequently change. Therefore, using PlantUML for WBS diagrams combines the clarity of **visual breakdown** with the agility and control of a **text-based system**, making it a valuable asset in **efficient project management**.


## OrgMode syntax

This syntax is compatible with OrgMode

```plantuml
@startwbs
* Business Process Modelling WBS
** Launch the project
*** Complete Stakeholder Research
*** Initial Implementation Plan
** Design phase
*** Model of AsIs Processes Completed
**** Model of AsIs Processes Completed1
**** Model of AsIs Processes Completed2
*** Measure AsIs performance metrics
*** Identify Quick Wins
** Complete innovate phase
@endwbs
```


## Change direction

You can change direction using ``<`` and ``>``

```plantuml
@startwbs
* Business Process Modelling WBS
** Launch the project
*** Complete Stakeholder Research
*** Initial Implementation Plan
** Design phase
*** Model of AsIs Processes Completed
****< Model of AsIs Processes Completed1
****> Model of AsIs Processes Completed2
***< Measure AsIs performance metrics
***< Identify Quick Wins
@endwbs
```


## Arithmetic notation

You can use the following notation to choose diagram side.

```plantuml
@startwbs
+ New Job
++ Decide on Job Requirements
+++ Identity gaps
+++ Review JDs
++++ Sign-Up for courses
++++ Volunteer
++++ Reading
++- Checklist
+++- Responsibilities
+++- Location
++ CV Upload Done
+++ CV Updated
++++ Spelling & Grammar
++++ Check dates
---- Skills
+++ Recruitment sites chosen
@endwbs
```


## Multilines

You can use ``:`` and ``;`` to have multilines box, as on [MindMap](mindmap-diagram#4ea2ymh57pwsk99qth2e).

```plantuml
@startwbs
* <&flag> Debian
** <&globe> Ubuntu

***:Linux Mint
Open Source;

*** Kubuntu
*** ...
@endwbs
```

*[Ref. [QA-13945](https://forum.plantuml.net/13945)]*


## Removing box

You can use underscore ``_`` to remove box drawing.

### Boxless on Arithmetic notation
#### Several boxless node
```plantuml
@startwbs
+ Project
 + Part One
  + Task 1.1
   - LeftTask 1.2
   + Task 1.3
  + Part Two
   + Task 2.1
   + Task 2.2
   -_ Task 2.2.1 To the left boxless
   -_ Task 2.2.2 To the Left boxless
   +_ Task 2.2.3 To the right boxless
@endwbs
```
#### All boxless node
```plantuml
@startwbs
+_ Project
 +_ Part One
  +_ Task 1.1
   -_ LeftTask 1.2
   +_ Task 1.3
  +_ Part Two
   +_ Task 2.1
   +_ Task 2.2
   -_ Task 2.2.1 To the left boxless
   -_ Task 2.2.2 To the Left boxless
   +_ Task 2.2.3 To the right boxless
@endwbs
```

### Boxless on OrgMode syntax
#### Several boxless node
```plantuml
@startwbs
* World
** America 
***_ Canada 
***_ Mexico
***_ USA
** Europe
***_  England
***_  Germany
***_  Spain
@endwbs
```
*[Ref. [QA-13297](https://forum.plantuml.net/13297)]*

#### All boxless node
```plantuml
@startwbs
*_ World
**_ America 
***_ Canada 
***_ Mexico
***_ USA
**_ Europe
***_  England
***_  Germany
***_  Spain
@endwbs
```
*[Ref. [QA-13355](https://forum.plantuml.net/13355)]*


## Colors (with inline or style color)

It is possible to change node [color](color):

* with inline color
```plantuml
@startwbs
*[#SkyBlue] this is the partner workpackage
**[#pink] this is my workpackage
** this is another workpackage
@endwbs
```
```plantuml
@startwbs
+[#SkyBlue] this is the partner workpackage
++[#pink] this is my workpackage
++ this is another workpackage
@endwbs
```

*[Ref. [QA-12374](https://forum.plantuml.net/12374), only from v1.2020.20]*

* with style color
```plantuml
@startwbs
<style>
wbsDiagram {
  .pink {
      BackgroundColor pink
  }
  .your_style_name {
      BackgroundColor SkyBlue
  }
}
</style>
* this is the partner workpackage <<your_style_name>>
** this is my workpackage <<pink>>
**:This is on multiple
lines; <<pink>>
** this is another workpackage
@endwbs
```
```plantuml
@startwbs
<style>
wbsDiagram {
  .pink {
      BackgroundColor pink
  }
  .your_style_name {
      BackgroundColor SkyBlue
  }
}
</style>
+ this is the partner workpackage <<your_style_name>>
++ this is my workpackage <<pink>>
++:This is on multiple
lines; <<pink>>
++ this is another workpackage
@endwbs
```


## Using style

It is possible to change diagram style.

```plantuml
@startwbs
<style>
wbsDiagram {
  // all lines (meaning connector and borders, there are no other lines in WBS) are black by default
  Linecolor black
  arrow {
    // note that connector are actually "arrow" even if they don't look like as arrow
    // This is to be consistent with other UML diagrams. Not 100% sure that it's a good idea
    // So now connector are green
    LineColor green
  }
  :depth(0) {
      // will target root node
      BackgroundColor White
      RoundCorner 10
      LineColor red
      // Because we are targetting depth(0) for everything, border and connector for level 0 will be red
  }
  arrow {
    :depth(2) {
      // Targetting only connector between Mexico-Chihuahua and USA-Texas
      LineColor blue
      LineStyle 4
      LineThickness .5
    }
  }
  node {
    :depth(2) {
      LineStyle 2
      LineThickness 2.5
    }
  }
  boxless {
    // will target boxless node with '_'
    FontColor darkgreen
  }  
}
</style>
* World
** America 
*** Canada 
*** Mexico
**** Chihuahua
*** USA
**** Texas
***< New York 
** Europe
***_  England
***_  Germany
***_  Spain
@endwbs
```


## Word Wrap

Using ``MaximumWidth`` setting you can control automatic word wrap. Unit used is pixel.

```plantuml
@startwbs


<style>
node {
    Padding 12
    Margin 3
    HorizontalAlignment center
    LineColor blue
    LineThickness 3.0
    BackgroundColor gold
    RoundCorner 40
    MaximumWidth 100
}

rootNode {
    LineStyle 8.0;3.0
    LineColor red
    BackgroundColor white
    LineThickness 1.0
    RoundCorner 0
    Shadowing 0.0
}

leafNode {
    LineColor gold
    RoundCorner 0
    Padding 3
}

arrow {
    LineStyle 4
    LineThickness 0.5
    LineColor green
}
</style>

* Hi =)
** sometimes i have node in wich i want to write a long text
*** this results in really huge diagram
**** of course, i can explicit split with a\nnew line
**** but it could be cool if PlantUML was able to split long lines, maybe with an option who specify the maximum width of a node

## Add arrows between WBS elements

You can add arrows between WBS elements.

Using alias with `as`:
```plantuml
@startwbs
<style>
.foo {
  LineColor #00FF00;
}
</style>
* Test
** A topic
*** "common" as c1
*** "common2" as c2
** "Another topic" as t2
t2 -> c1 <<foo>>
t2 ..> c2 #blue
@endwbs
```

Using alias in parentheses:
```plantuml
@startwbs
* Test
**(b) A topic
***(c1) common
**(t2) Another topic
t2 --> c1
b -> t2 #blue
@endwbs
```

*[Ref. [QA-16251](https://forum.plantuml.net/16251/link-between-objet-in-wbs)]*


## Creole on WBS diagram

You can use [Creole or HTML Creole](creole) on WBS:

```plantuml
@startwbs
* Creole on WBS
**:==Creole
  This is **bold**
  This is //italics//
  This is ""monospaced""
  This is --stricken-out--
  This is __underlined__
  This is ~~wave-underlined~~
--test Unicode and icons--
  This is <U+221E> long
  This is a <&code> icon
  Use image : <img:https://plantuml.com/logo3.png>
;
**: <b>HTML Creole 
  This is <b>bold</b>
  This is <i>italics</i>
  This is <font:monospaced>monospaced</font>
  This is <s>stroked</s>
  This is <u>underlined</u>
  This is <w>waved</w>
  This is <s:green>stroked</s>
  This is <u:red>underlined</u>
  This is <w:#0000FF>waved</w>
-- other examples --
  This is <color:blue>Blue</color>
  This is <back:orange>Orange background</back>
  This is <size:20>big</size>
;
**:==Creole line

Or strong line
____
Or dotted line
..My title..
Or dotted title
//and title... //
==Title==
Or double-line title
--Another title--
Or single-line title
Enjoy!;
**:==Creole list item
