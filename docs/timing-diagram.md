## Timing Diagram

A [Timing Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_diagram_%28Unified_Modeling_Language%29) in UML is a specific type of **interaction diagram** that visualizes the **timing constraints** of a system. It focuses on the **chronological order of events**, showcasing how different objects interact with each other over time. **Timing diagrams** are especially useful in **real-time systems** and **embedded systems** to understand the behavior of objects throughout a given period.


## Declaring element or participant

You declare participant using the following keywords, depending on how you want them to be drawn.

| Keyword | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ``analog``  | An ``analog`` signal is continuous, and the values are linearly interpolated between the given setpoints |
| ``binary``  | A `binary` signal restricted to only 2 states |
| ``clock``   | A `clocked` signal that repeatedly transitions from high to low, with a `period`, and an optional `pulse` and `offset` |
| ``concise`` | A simplified ``concise`` signal designed to show the movement of data (great for messages) |
| ``robust``  | A ``robust`` complex line signal designed to show the transition from one state to another (can have many states) |



You define state change using the ``@`` notation, and the ``is`` verb.

```plantuml
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle

@100
WU is Waiting
WB is Processing

@300
WB is Waiting
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
clock   "Clock_0"   as C0 with period 50
clock   "Clock_1"   as C1 with period 50 pulse 15 offset 10
binary  "Binary"  as B
concise "Concise" as C
robust  "Robust"  as R
analog  "Analog"  as A


@0
C is Idle
R is Idle
A is 0

@100
B is high
C is Waiting
R is Processing
A is 3

@300
R is Waiting
A is 1
@enduml
```

*[Ref. [QA-14631](https://forum.plantuml.net/14631), [QA-14647](https://forum.plantuml.net/14647) and [QA-11288](https://forum.plantuml.net/11288/mixed-signal-timing-diagram)]*


## Binary and Clock

It's also possible to have binary and clock signal, using the following keywords:

* ``binary``
* ``clock``

```plantuml
@startuml
clock clk with period 1
binary "Enable" as EN

@0
EN is low

@5
EN is high

@10
EN is low
@enduml
```


## Adding message

You can add message using the following syntax.

```plantuml
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle

@100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is Waiting
WB is Processing

@300
WB is Waiting
@enduml
```



## Relative time

It is possible to use relative time with ``@``.
```plantuml
@startuml
robust "DNS Resolver" as DNS
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle
DNS is Idle

@+100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is Waiting
WB is Processing

@+200
WB is Waiting
WB -> DNS@+50 : Resolve URL

@+100
DNS is Processing

@+300
DNS is Idle
@enduml
```



## Anchor Points

Instead of using absolute or relative time on an absolute time you can define a time as an anchor point by using the ``as`` keyword and starting the name with a ``:``. 

```
@XX as :<anchor point name>
```


```plantuml
@startuml
clock clk with period 1
binary "enable" as EN
concise "dataBus" as db

@0 as :start
@5 as :en_high 
@10 as :en_low
@:en_high-2 as :en_highMinus2

@:start
EN is low
db is "0x0000"

@:en_high
EN is high

@:en_low
EN is low

@:en_highMinus2
db is "0xf23a"

@:en_high+6
db is "0x0000"
@enduml
```


## Participant oriented

Rather than declare the diagram in chronological order, you can define it by participant.

```plantuml
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Proc.
+100 is Waiting

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```



## Setting scale
You can also set a specific scale.
```plantuml
@startuml
concise "Web User" as WU
scale 100 as 50 pixels

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

When using absolute Times/Dates, 1 "tick" is equivalent to 1 second.
```plantuml
@startuml
concise "Season" as S
'30 days is scaled to 50 pixels
scale 2592000 as 50 pixels

@2000/11/01
S is "Winter"

@2001/02/01
S is "Spring"

@2001/05/01
S is "Summer"

@2001/08/01
S is "Fall"
@enduml
```


## Initial state
You can also define an inital state.
```plantuml
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

WB is Initializing
WU is Absent

@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Processing
+100 is Waiting

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```



## Intricated state

A signal could be in some undefined state.

### Intricated or undefined robust state
```plantuml
@startuml
robust "Signal1" as S1
robust "Signal2" as S2
S1 has 0,1,2,hello
S2 has 0,1,2
@0
S1 is 0
S2 is 0
@100
S1 is {0,1} #SlateGrey
S2 is {0,1}
@200
S1 is 1
S2 is 0
@300
S1 is hello
S2 is {0,2}
@enduml
```

### Intricated or undefined binary state
```plantuml
@startuml
clock "Clock" as C with period 2
binary "Enable" as EN

@0
EN is low
@1
EN is high
@3
EN is low
@5
EN is {low,high}
@10
EN is low
@enduml
```

*[Ref. [QA-11936](https://forum.plantuml.net/11936) and [QA-15933](https://forum.plantuml.net/15933)]*


## Hidden state

It is also possible to hide some state.

```plantuml
@startuml
concise "Web User" as WU

WU is {-}

@100
WU is A1

@200
WU is {-}

@300
WU is {hidden}

@400
WU is A3

@500

concise substate1
robust bit2

bit2 has HIGH,LOW

@state0
0 is 18_start
6 is s_dPause
8 is 10_data
14 is {hidden}

@substate1
0 is sSeq

```

*[Ref. [QA-7019](https://forum.plantuml.net/7019/hh-mm-ss-time-format-in-timing-diagram)]*


## Change Date Format

It is also possible to change date format.

```plantuml
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

use date format "YY-MM-dd"

@2019/07/02
WU is Idle
WB is Idle

@2019/07/04
WU is Waiting : some note
WB is Processing : some other note

@2019/07/05
WB is Waiting
@enduml
```


## Manage time axis labels

You can manage the time-axis labels.

### Label on each tick _(by default)_
```plantuml
@startuml
scale 31536000 as 40 pixels
use date format "yy-MM"

concise "OpenGL Desktop" as OD

@1992/01/01
OD is {hidden}

@enduml
```


### Manual label _(only when the state changes)_
```plantuml
@startuml
scale 31536000 as 40 pixels

manual time-axis
use date format "yy-MM"

concise "OpenGL Desktop" as OD

## Adding constraint
It is possible to display time constraints on the diagrams.
```plantuml
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

WB is Initializing
WU is Absent

@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Processing
+100 is Waiting
WB@0 <-> @50 : {50 ms lag}

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@200 <-> @+150 : {150 ms}
@enduml
```




## Highlighted period

You can higlight a part of diagram.

```plantuml
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle

@100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is Waiting #LightCyan;line:Aqua

@200
WB is Proc.

@300
WU -> WB@350 : URL2
WB is Waiting

@+200
WU is ok

@+200
WB is Idle

highlight 200 to 450 #Gold;line:DimGrey : This is my caption
highlight 600 to 700 : This is another\nhighlight
@enduml
```


*[Ref. [QA-10868](https://forum.plantuml.net/10868/highlighted-periods-in-timing-diagrams)]*


## Using notes

You can use the ``note top of`` and ``note bottom of``
keywords to define notes related to a single object or participant *(available only for *`concise`* or *`binary`* object).*

```plantuml
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle

@100
WU is Waiting
WB is Processing
note top of WU : first note\non several\nlines
note bottom of WU : second note\non several\nlines

@300
WB is Waiting
@enduml
```

*[Ref. [QA-6877](https://forum.plantuml.net/6877), [GH-1465](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/issues/1465)]*


## Adding texts

You can optionally add a title, a header, a footer, a legend and a caption:

```plantuml
@startuml
Title This is my title
header: some header
footer: some footer
legend
Some legend
end legend
caption some caption

robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

db@:write_beg-1 <-> @:write_end : setup time
db@:write_beg-1 -> addr@:write_end+1 : hold
@enduml
```


## Adding color

You can add [color](color).

```plantuml
@startuml
concise "LR" as LR
concise "ST" as ST

LR is AtPlace #palegreen
ST is AtLoad #gray

@LR
0 is Lowering
100 is Lowered #pink
350 is Releasing
 
@ST
200 is Moving
@enduml
```

*[Ref. [QA-5776](https://forum.plantuml.net/5776)]*


## Using (global) style

### Without style *(by default)*
```plantuml
@startuml
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

WB is Initializing
WU is Absent

@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Processing
+100 is Waiting
WB@0 <-> @50 : {50 ms lag}

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@200 <-> @+150 : {150 ms}
@enduml
```


### With style

You can use [style](style-evolution) to change rendering of elements.

```plantuml
@startuml
<style>
timingDiagram {
  document {
    BackGroundColor SandyBrown
  }
 constraintArrow {
  LineStyle 2-1
  LineThickness 3
  LineColor Blue
 }
}
</style>
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

WB is Initializing
WU is Absent

@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Processing
+100 is Waiting
WB@0 <-> @50 : {50 ms lag}

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@200 <-> @+150 : {150 ms}
@enduml
```

*[Ref.  [QA-14340](https://forum.plantuml.net/14340/color-of-arrow-in-timing-diagram)]*


## Applying Colors to specific lines

You can use the `<style>` tags and sterotyping to give a name to line attributes.

```plantuml
@startuml
<style>
timingDiagram {
  .red {
    LineColor red
  }
  .blue {
    LineColor blue
    LineThickness 5
  }
}
</style>

clock clk with period 1
binary "Input Signal 1"  as IS1
binary "Input Signal 2"  as IS2 <<blue>>
binary "Output Signal 1" as OS1 <<red>>

@0
IS1 is low
IS2 is high
OS1 is low
@2
OS1 is high
@4
OS1 is low
@5
IS1 is high
OS1 is high
@6
IS2 is low
@10
IS1 is low
OS1 is low
@enduml
```

## Scaling analog signal

You can scale analog signal.

### Without scaling: 0-max _(by default)_
```plantuml
@startuml
title Between 0-max (by default)
analog "Analog" as A

@0
A is 350

@100
A is 450

@300
A is 350
@enduml
```


### With scaling: min-max
```plantuml
@startuml
